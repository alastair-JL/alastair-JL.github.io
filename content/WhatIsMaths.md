For most people, mathematics if figuring out how much money they'll have after rent, or how many hours it'll take to drive six hundred kilometers south for their cousins wedding. All this **is** mathematics, but it isn't really the type of mathematics that mathematics researchers do and get paid for. Most of us are actually pretty terrible at this sort of practical planning, and will usually arrive at cousins wedding five hours too early/late. Oh well.

In terms of mathematics research there are two main types of mathematics to talk about: Pure Mathematics, and Applied mathematics. Most of my work is closer to Applied Mathematics, and so that's what I'll be describing here. Pure Mathematics we can talk about later.


Suppose you have a thing you care about. It might be a forest, or a country or the cells in a particular persons body. It might the stock market, or the world's supply of copper, or peoples opinions of electoral reform.

It might be the world. There are lots of things that people care about.

The core idea of applied mathematics is to take this thing you care about, and figure out all the most important rules, and *paint a picture* using those rules.

If your painting is good, and you've painted all the most important rules into it, then the way your paint works will let you make predictions. Learning about the painting will let you learn about that real object behind it.

This is the idea behind Mathematical Modelling, and is the main job of people who do Applied Mathematicians like me.

Now, sometimes this can go horribly wrong. If your model is wrong, if you have a bad picture of the thing you care about, then all you will get is lies. There are two main ways modelling can go wrong.

Sometimes, you'll assume something that isn't true about the world, or you'll ignore something that is true, and is important. If you assume the world is cube shaped, it doesn't matter how good you are at mathematical modelling, you are always going to get the wrong answer.

The other way for the model to be wrong is if you are just terrbile at drawing. If 2+2 = lemon, you are going to have a bad day.

If you are good at mathematics, but bad at science, you are likely to create pictures that look like cubeworld. If you are good at science, but bad at mathematics, you might end up with models that look a little bit like scribble.

The job of an Applied Mathematician is to get both of these things right, and then use our models to answer questions about things that people care about. This involves lots of talking to other people who know more about the thing we are trying to draw a picture of, to make sure we do it right, and also lots of time glaring at whiteboards and computers and cursing the world for being so god damn complicated. 

A lot of the time this does not work. When it does work, it feels a lot like being a wizard.


**Sure, fine, so HOW do I make a mathematical model?**

**Okay, models are nice, but what's the deal with pure mathematics?**
