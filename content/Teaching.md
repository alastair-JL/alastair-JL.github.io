# Teaching
I have most recently taught:

* [Computational Mathematics](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/62389) at University of Auckland

* [Numerical Computation](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/62027) at University of Auckland


If you are in either of those courses, go check out their canvas pages.

I've also been running virtual tutorials in [Gather.town](https://gather.town/app/dRtTCqio62mFFdnm/AucklandMathsStudySpace).
