# Teaching
I am currently teaching:
* [Partial Differential Equations](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/74529) at University of Auckland

* [Inverse Problems and Stochastic Differential Equations](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/74452) at University of Auckland

If you are in either of those courses, go check out their canvas pages.

I've also been running virtual tutorials in [Gather.town](https://gather.town/app/dRtTCqio62mFFdnm/AucklandMathsStudySpace). 
By the looks of it, we'll be back on campus in person soon, so you'll be able to attend tutorials in person.
