## Pattern Formation In the Min System
Symmetry breaking and pattern formation are critical to the existence of complex life in the world around us, and have fascinated researchers for [many years](http://hopf.chem.brandeis.edu/members_content/yanglingfa/pattern/Turing/The%20Chemical%20Basis%20of%20Morphogenesis.pdf).

A particularly beautiful example of this is the Min system for cell division, in which the regulatory proteins MinD and MinE ensure cell division down the midline of the cell through a ``chase and release'' mechanism that inhibits cell division near either cell pole (depicted right).
[Recent experiments](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/02/10/1600644113.abstract) by [Vecchiarelli](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/vecchiarelli-lab/author/ave/) et al. using fluorescently marked Min Proteins were able to demonstrate a wide variety of novel spatial-temporal patterns depending on the exact concentrations used.

As part of my PhD thesis with [Eric Cytrynbaum](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cytryn/index.shtml), I investigated possible mechanisms for ``Burst'' like pattern formation- using Large deviation theory to demonstrate how autocatalytic systems near a bifurcation point can quickly form circular bursts as seen in Vecchiarelli's experiments.

## Evolutionary Dynamics

Evolution is the driving force behind the creation of complexity in our world. Early models of evolutionary dynamics considered ``well mixed'' populations in which all individuals competed with all other individuals and geometry was ignored. Later models considered explicitly spatial populations - for example on a [network or a lattice](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03204).

My Master's degree research with [Christoph Hauert](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~hauert/), sought to resolve a particularly thorny contradiction in the literature, in which one researcher had proved that a particular network structure, known as a superstar, [was able to ``amplify'' evolutionary pressure](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03204) by an arbitrarily large amount, such that even the slightest advantage could would lead to evolutionary success - overwhelming the inherit randomness in the system. Another group of researchers, however, [provided a counterexample to this claim](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2013.0193), demonstrating an analytic upper bound far below the lower bound given in the original paper, along with supporting simulation results.

During my thesis, [I was able to prove](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519315003082) that the superstar can provide arbitrarily strong evolutionary pressure in a suitable limit, however this approach to infinity is significantly slower than originally calculated, and thus in agreement with [the counterexample provided by DÃ­az et al](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2013.0193).

  

## Collaborations Outside of Mathematics

Mathematics is fun, but I also do my best to find collaborations outside of mathematics whenever possible. Below are a couple of my collaborations, if you are currently working on an interesting project which could potentially use a little bit of mathematics, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:alastair.jamieson-lane@auckland.ac.nz).

### CIB Analysis.
Cross impact Balance Analysis is an analysis technique from sociology in which we take a bunch of expert opinions on how aspects of a system effect one another (for example, how education effects economy, how economy effects politics), and combine these together in a systematic way in order to determine what possible states of the system can be considered `stable'. 

During my time at the [Complex Systems Summer School](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/schools/sfi-complex-systems-summer-school)  in [Santa Fe](https://www.santafe.edu/) I was able to collaborate with [Dr. Vanessa Schweizer](https://uwaterloo.ca/knowledge-integration/faculty-schweizer) (along with many other excellent people) in extending this tool to consider stochastic effects.
You can read a blog post about that work [here](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/markov-models-of-social-change-part-1/), with a follow up post by Vanessa [here](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/markov-models-of-social-change-part-2/). I also constructed an [R package](https://github.com/alastair-JL/StochasticCIB) that can be used to implement this technique at home.
Like all things involved in the predicting people and societies, how far to trust such methods is a matter of debate.

### Consensus Analysis and Freelist Data.

Cultural Consensus analysis and Freelist Salience analysis are techniques from Anthropology used to combine responses from a large number of individuals in order to gain an understanding of the general opinions of the border society. While living in [Green College](https://greencollege.ubc.ca/), I had the chance collaborate with [Dr. Benjamin Purzycki](https://bgpurzycki.wordpress.com/) in building the [AnthroTools R Package](https://anthrotools.wordpress.com/about/), which can be found on GitHub [Here](https://github.com/alastair-JL/AnthroTools).
Our primary goal in constructing this package was to make CCA and Freelist methods freely available outside of proprietary software. While building this package, I was able to construct a number of data simulation tools, allowing users to predict how variable they might expect their data to be in a variety of situations.
