<h2 id="pattern-formation-in-the-min-system">Pattern Formation In the Min System</h2>

<p>Symmetry breaking and pattern formation are critical to the existence of complex life in the world around us, and have fascinated researchers for <a href="http://hopf.chem.brandeis.edu/members_content/yanglingfa/pattern/Turing/The%20Chemical%20Basis%20of%20Morphogenesis.pdf">many years</a>.</p>

<p>A particularly beautiful example of this is the Min system for cell division, in which the regulatory proteins MinD and MinE ensure cell division down the midline of the cell through a ``chase and release&rdquo; mechanism that inhibits cell division near either cell pole (depicted right).<br />
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/02/10/1600644113.abstract">Recent experiments</a> by <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/vecchiarelli-lab/author/ave/">Vecchiarelli</a> et al. using fluorescently marked Min Proteins were able to demonstrate a wide variety of novel spatial-temporal patterns depending on the exact concentrations used.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/BurstsAppearForWeb.png#center" alt="your_img" /></p>

<p>As part of my PhD thesis with <a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cytryn/index.shtml">Eric Cytrynbaum</a>, I investigated possible mechanisms for ``Burst&rdquo; like pattern formation- using Large deviation theory to demonstrate how autocatalytic systems near a bifurcation point can quickly form circular bursts as seen in Vecchiarelli&rsquo;s experiments.</p>

<h2 id="evolutionary-dynamics">Evolutionary Dynamics</h2>

<p>Evolution is the driving force behind the creation of complexity in our world. Early models of evolutionary dynamics considered ``well mixed&rdquo; populations in which all individuals competed with all other individuals and geometry was ignored. Later models considered explicitly spatial populations - for example on a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03204">network or a lattice</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/Superstar.png#floatleft" alt="your_img" /><br />
My Master&rsquo;s degree research with <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~hauert/">Christoph Hauert</a>, sought to resolve a particularly thorny contradiction in the literature, in which one researcher had proved that a particular network structure, known as a superstar, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03204">was able to ``amplify&rdquo; evolutionary pressure</a> by an arbitrarily large amount, such that even the slightest advantage could would lead to evolutionary success - overwhelming the inherit randomness in the system. Another group of researchers, however, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2013.0193">provided a counterexample to this claim</a>, demonstrating an analytic upper bound far below the lower bound given in the original paper, along with supporting simulation results.</p>

<p>During my thesis, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519315003082">I was able to prove</a> that the superstar can provide arbitrarily strong evolutionary pressure in a suitable limit, however this approach to infinity is significantly slower than originally calculated, and thus in agreement with <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2013.0193">the counterexample provided by DÃ­az et al</a>.</p>

<h2 id="collaborations-outside-of-mathematics">Collaborations Outside of Mathematics</h2>

<p>Mathematics is fun, but I also do my best to find collaborations outside of mathematics whenever possible. Below are a couple of my collaborations, if you are currently working on an interesting project which could potentially use a little bit of mathematics, feel free to <a href="mailto:alastair.jamieson-lane@uni-oldenburg.de">get in touch</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cib-analysis">CIB Analysis.</h3>

<p>Cross impact Balance Analysis is an analysis technique from sociology in which we take a bunch of expert opinions on how aspects of a system effect one another (for example, how education effects economy, how economy effects politics), and combine these together in a systematic way in order to determine what possible states of the system can be considered `stable&rsquo;.</p>

<p>During my time at the <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/schools/sfi-complex-systems-summer-school">Complex Systems Summer School</a>  in <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/">Santa Fe</a> I was able to collaborate with <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/knowledge-integration/faculty-schweizer">Dr. Vanessa Schweizer</a> (along with many other excellent people) in extending this tool to consider stochastic effects.<br />
You can read a blog post about that work <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/markov-models-of-social-change-part-1/">here</a>, with a follow up post by Vanessa <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/markov-models-of-social-change-part-2/">here</a>. I also constructed an <a href="https://github.com/alastair-JL/StochasticCIB">R package</a> that can be used to implement this technique at home.<br />
Like all things involved in the predicting people and societies, how far to trust such methods is a matter of debate.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/FreelistImage.png#floatleft" alt="your_img" /></p>

<h3 id="consensus-analysis-and-freelist-data">Consensus Analysis and Freelist Data.</h3>

<p>Cultural Consensus analysis and Freelist Salience analysis are techniques from Anthropology used to combine responses from a large number of individuals in order to gain an understanding of the general opinions of the border society. While living in <a href="https://greencollege.ubc.ca/">Green College</a>, I had the chance collaborate with <a href="https://bgpurzycki.wordpress.com/">Dr. Benjamin Purzycki</a> in building the <a href="https://anthrotools.wordpress.com/about/">AnthroTools R Package</a>, which can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/alastair-JL/AnthroTools">Here</a>.<br />
Our primary goal in constructing this package was to make CCA and Freelist methods freely available outside of proprietary software. While building this package, I was able to construct a number of data simulation tools, allowing users to predict how variable they might expect their data to be in a variety of situations.</p>
